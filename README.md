<!-- Pre-requirements -->
### Pre-requirements 📋

_Que cosas necesitas para instalar el software y como instalarlas_

```
sudo apt install python3.8
sudo apt-get install gfortran
```
You also need/want to install VMD software
For installation following the steps below: Download it from (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) Then in the terminal type:
```
cd Downloads
  tar -zxvf vmd-1.9.1.bin.LINUXAMD64.opengl.tar.gz
```
This will extract the folder to your downloads folder. You can then just
```
cd vmd-1.9.1

./configure LINUXAMD64

cd src

sudo make install
```

<!-- Usage -->
## Usage ⚙️
In order to run this program, the necessary files are found in the [Working_area](https://github.com/Eines-Informatiques-Avancades/Project-II/tree/master/Working_Area) directory.

This directory contains the following files:

- **Makefile**: Compiles and executes the whole program. It is also designed to manage all the generated files for a more user-friendly experience.
- **parameters.txt**: Data file that contains all the parameters related to the system of study (Number of particles, geometry of the lattice, density, mass,...), the data related to the simulation (Initial temperature, initial distribution, thermostat, integration method,...) and a final section where the names of the output data files are defined. Additionaly, this file contains the necessary parameters in order to run correctly the radial distribution function (g(r)) calculation. 

To start using the program, the following command has to be used:
```
make all
```
This will compile and execute the program and all the statistic calculations will also be performed. It is **important** to point out that in order to perform the whole program, the user is asked a couple of questions related to the statistical study, so keep an eye on this, otherwise the program will not reach completion.

Once the process has been completed, the unnecessary files are cleaned and the output files are sent to their corresponding directories (Results -> Data and Figures).

**Note**: Due to the modular nature of the program, it can be executed in parts (or modules) by using the following commands:

```
# Compilation of the Main program and the gofr module (Fortran programming language)
make compile

# Execution of the Main program and the gofr module (Fortran programming language)
make run

# Computes the statistical analysis and generates the corresponding figures as outputs (Python programming language)
make statistic

# Data files and figures (outputs) to  the Results folder
make move

# Removes objects, executables and unnecessary .mod files
make clean
```

To visualize the trajectory of the system, VMD software is needed.
